# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a map showing earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. Specifically, we are highlighting the locations where there are earthquake magnitudes of 4.5 or higher.


##Results
We created a map using Leaflet, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, in addition to mapbox.com.
The map has 3 map styles, streets, satellite, and dark, which can be selected on the top right corner of the map.
There are also additional layers on the map, Tectonic Plate Data, Earthquake Data, and Major Earthquake Data.

*Tectonic Plate Data: Represented by the red lines on the map.

*Earthquake Data: Represented by the circle on the map the radius of the circles is based on the size of the earthquakes.

*Major Earthquake Data: The major earthquake data showcs earthquake data for earthquakes with a 4.5 magnitude or higher. Similar to the earthquake data, these data points will also have a circle radius, popup marker and will follow the current legend and color scale.

*Legend: Located on the bottem right portion of the map, shows how the circles are colored based on the earthquake magnitudes.
